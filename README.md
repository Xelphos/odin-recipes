Recipe website project for The Odin Project curriculum.

This is an assignment for The Odin Project where I am tasked with making a basic website for recipes.

First task in this assignment seems to be asking me to write down what skills I think I will have demonstrated by the time I am done, but since I am a man of few words, this won't be very long.

When this assignment is finished I should have shown my ability create an HTML file along with adding the basic structure(boilerplate), build and format each pages in a readable way using elements like headers(<h1> through <h6>), paragraphs(<p>), unordered(<ul>) and ordered(<ol>) lists, text formatting like bold(<strong>) and italics<em>, making use of images(<img>) to add a bit of flair and links(<a>) so that you are able to move around the website.
