        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray an 8x8 inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix the ricotta cheese, spinach, 1 1/2 cups Romano cheese, eggs, salt and pepper to taste in a bowl.</li>
                <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread 1/4 cup of spaghetti sauce in the bottom of the prepared baking dish,
                     and place frozen raviolis on top in a single layer. Spread about 1 cup of the ricotta mixture over the raviolis. 
                     Repeat the layers 3 more times, ending with a layer of frozen raviolis. Spread with 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce,
                     and sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup of Romano cheese on top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, until the casserole is bubbling. Then remove the aluminum foil,
                     and bake another 10 minutes to brown the cheese on top. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
