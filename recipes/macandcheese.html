        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) package bacon</li>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
                <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons barbeque rub</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a pizza pan with aluminum foil; lay bacon strips on top.</li>
                <li>Bake bacon in the preheated oven until browned and crisp, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water,
                     stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Drain bacon slices on paper towels and allow to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
                     Place in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until crumbly.</li>
                <li>Preheat a smoker to 275 to 300 degrees F (135 to 150 degrees C). Add wood chips according to manufacturer's directions.</li>
                <li>Mix together cream, Cheddar cheese, Colby-Jack cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise, butter,
                     and barbeque rub in the warm pasta pot; add drained macaroni. Mix well and let the cheese melt.
                     Pour into a 9x13-inch aluminum pan and sprinkle bacon on top.</li>
                <li>Place the pan on the rack in the preheated smoker. Cook until cheese is bubbly, about 3 1/2 hours.</li>
            </ol>
